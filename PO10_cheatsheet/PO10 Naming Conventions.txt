MACRO NAMING CONVENTIONS:

@rst:[0-100]

A percentage between 0 and 100. 
Parameter will be reset to value when:
	encoder button is pressed
	HK is pressed
	HK is triggered via kills device.

@hk:[0-100]

A percentage between 0 and 100. 
Parameter will be reset to value when:
	HK is pressed
	HK is triggered via kills device.

@sk:[0-100]

A percentage between 0 and 100. 
Parameter will be reset to value when:
	SK is pressed
	SK is triggered via kills device.

@tog

Parameter will be toggled between on and off (minimum and maximum) when encoder button is pressed.

@max

Parameter will be set to maximum value when encoder button is pressed.

@min

Parameter will be set to minimum value when encoder button is pressed.

@onoff

Device rack will toggle on or off when encoder button is pressed.

@shft:[parameter name]

If parameter name matches another parameter in the same rack, when the encoder button is pressed it will be assigned to that parameter.

@param:[parameter name]:

If parameter name matches another parameter in the same rack, when the encoder button is pressed it will toggle that parameter between its minimum and maximum.

@param:[parameter name]:rst:[0-100]

A percentage between 0 and 100. 
If parameter name matches another parameter in the same rack, when the encoder button is pressed it will reset the parameter to the percentage of maximum.

@default

All of the rack device's parameters will be set to @rst or @hk values when the encoder button is pressed.



SCENE NAMING CONVENTIONS:

Any scene ending with the @HK tag will cause all parameters in the entire Live set to be changed to @hk or @rst or @def values if they are tagged.

Any scene ending with the @SK tag will cause all parameters in the entire Live set to be changed to @sk values if they are tagged.


HEX MACRO NAMING CONVENTIONS:

@def:[0-100]

A percentage between 0 and 100. 
Parameter will be reset to value when:
	HK is pressed
	HK is triggered via kills device.
	def button is pressed on hex GUI.
	Second from right (yellow) button is pressed in GUI or the corresponding button on the PO10.
